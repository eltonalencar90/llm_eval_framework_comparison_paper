Windows uses binary notation to calculate disk space, where 1 kilobyte (KB) is 1024 bytes, 1 megabyte (MB) is 1024 kilobytes, and so on. However, manufacturers typically use decimal notation to calculate disk space, where 1 kilobyte is 1000 bytes, 1 megabyte is 1000 kilobytes, and so on. This difference in calculation methods can result in a discrepancy in the reported disk space in Windows compared to the manufacturer's specifications.

Additionally, some of the disk space may be allocated for system files, recovery partitions, or other hidden partitions, which are not included in the total usable space displayed in Windows.
