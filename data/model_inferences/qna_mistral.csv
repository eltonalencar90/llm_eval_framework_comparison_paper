1. **Use Power Adapter to Charge:** Avoid using your battery when it's fully charged and plugged into a power source. The computer will automatically switch to the power adapter for charging instead of using the battery.

2. **Keep Your MacBook Pro Cool:** Overheating can decrease battery life. Ensure there is adequate ventilation around your laptop, avoid placing it on soft surfaces or bed, and avoid exposing it to direct sunlight.

3. **Dim the Screen Brightness:** A brighter screen consumes more power. Lowering the screen brightness can help extend battery life.

4. **Manage Energy Usage:** Close unnecessary applications, especially those that use a lot of energy. You can monitor energy usage in the ""Energy Saver"" pane of System Preferences.

5. **Optimize Power Settings:** In the ""Energy Saver"" preference pane, you can adjust your power settings to conserve energy or provide high performance. Choose 'Power Saver' for battery conservation and 'High Performance' for better speed.

6. **Turn Off Visual Effects:** Some visual effects, like transparency and animated window movement, use more power. You can turn them off in the ""Mission Control"" pane of System Preferences.

7. **Disable Unnecessary Startup Items:** Applications that start up with your MacBook Pro consume battery power. You can manage startup items in the ""Users & Groups"" preference pane.

8. **Use 'Sleep' Mode:** When you're not using your laptop, put it to sleep instead of shutting it down completely. This helps conserve energy.

9. **Update Software Regularly:** Keeping your software up-to-date can help improve battery life by fixing bugs and optimizing power consumption.

10. **Use Original Apple Charger:** Using a charger other than the original Apple one could potentially damage your battery and reduce its lifespan."

However, the operating system (Windows) calculates the storage device capacity assuming that 1KB=1,024 Bytes, ulld therefore the capacity representation of the HDD in Windows is smaller than the actual capacity. The capacity representation in Windows may be smaller than the actual capacity because some programs occupy a certain area of the HDD outside of Windows. For models with Recovery, the HDD capacity representation in Windows may be smaller than the actual capacity because Recovery uses a hidden area of about 5~20GB of the HDD to save the recovery image, and that hidden area is not counted towards the total size available to Windows. The size of Recovery varies by models because of the different size of applied programs"," The discrepancy between the hard drive (HDD) capacity representation in Windows and the product specifications could be due to a few reasons:

1. Rounding: Capacities are often rounded down to the nearest usable size by manufacturers, while Windows reports the drive capacity as it is internally represented, which may not be an exact multiple of 512 bytes (the smallest addressable unit on most hard drives). This slight discrepancy can result in a difference between the reported and specified capacities.

2. Over-provisioning: Some manufacturers over-provision a portion of the drive to ensure optimal performance, which might lead to a smaller usable capacity compared to the advertised one.

3. Drives with Advanced Format (4Kn) sectors: Modern hard drives use 4K sector size, but older versions of Windows may report a smaller capacity due to their inability to fully utilize these larger sectors.

To resolve any discrepancies, you can use third-party tools such as CrystalDiskInfo or HD Tune to get accurate drive information. Additionally, ensure that your system's BIOS is up-to-date for optimal performance and accuracy of hard drive information."
