    "question": " My Internet connection doesn’t seem to be working. How do I set it up?",
    "answer": "There are different types of Internet connections. For example, you can connect using a modem, a DSL connection, a wireless AirPort connection, or an Ethernet network. You will need to supply Mac OS X with specific information about your connection type, Internet service provider, or network. The first step in configuring your connection is gathering the information needed for your connection type. To find out what information you need and for instructions on how to configure your connection type, see Appendix C, “Connecting to the Internet,” on page 113. Your computer also has a Setup Assistant application to help walk you through setting up an Internet connection. Open System Preferences and click Network. Click the “Assist me” button to open Network Setup Assistant.",

    "answer": "Begin by connecting your printer and installing any software according to the instructions that came with your printer. Next, open System Preferences and click the Print & Fax icon. Use the Print & Fax pane to configure your MacBook Pro to access the printer. You’ll find lots of information about setting up printers in Mac Help (choose Help > Mac Help from the menu bar and search for “printer”). Also see “Connecting to a Printer” on page 47 of this manual. If your printer isn’t working as expected, check the manufacturer’s website for updated print drivers. Often the latest printer software is available for downloading. If you sent a print job to your printer but it’s not printing, check to see if the job is stopped or on hold by clicking the printer icon in the Dock. (If no icon appears in the Dock, open Printer Setup Utility in the /Applications/Utilities/ folder and double-click the printer’s name.) If the window for the printer says “Job Stopped,” click the Start Jobs button. If “Hold” appears beside the job name, resume printing by clicking the job name and clicking Resume. If a print job has stopped printing because of a technical error, you can delete the faulty job by selecting the job and clicking Delete. You can then try printing the job again.",

    "answer": "Remember to calibrate your battery when you first use it (see “Calibrating Your Battery” on page 24). You can conserve battery power by using the Energy Saver preference pane to specify how quickly the computer should go to sleep or dim the display. Open System Preferences and click the Energy Saver icon. Choose settings that are optimized for your type of usage. Using peripheral devices such as hard disk drives, which get power from your computer, can also shorten the amount of time your battery lasts. You can conserve battery power by disconnecting such devices. You can also purchase full additional battery that you can swap in to your computer when power gets low. For more information about conserving battery power, see “Understanding Battery Conservation Tips” on page 77.",

    "answer": "The capacity of the storage device (HDD) of the manufacturer is calculated assuming that 1KB=1,000 Bytes. However, the operating system (Windows) calculates the storage device capacity assuming that 1KB=1,024 Bytes, ulld therefore the capacity representation of the HDD in Windows is smaller than the actual capacity. The capacity representation in Windows may be smaller than the actual capacity because some programs occupy a certain area of the HDD outside of Windows. For models with Recovery, the HDD capacity representation in Windows may be smaller than the actual capacity because Recovery uses a hidden area of about 5~20GB of the HDD to save the recovery image, and that hidden area is not counted towards the total size available to Windows. The size of Recovery varies by models because of the different size of applied programs",

    "answer": "Analog TVs require an analog video/audio signal. However, when playing a DVD, the signal transmitted to a TV is digital. Therefore either a digital-to-analog converter (in the DVD player) or an analog-to-digital converter (in the TV) is required. During this conversion, the picture quality is degraded due to noise and signal loss. DVI technology is superior because it requires no D/A conversion and is a pure digital signal from the player to your TV",

If you choose to move over your account, make sure you read Apple’s FAQ on the matter to ensure you’re not accidentally deleting data you haven’t backed up.",

La tarjeta SIM y sus contactos pueden dañarse fácilmente al rayarse o doblarse, así que tenga cuidado al manejar, instalar o retirar la tarjeta. Para instalar la tarjeta SIM:\n1. Presione y deslice la parte superior de la cubierta posterior para soltarla, luego continúe deslizando la cubierta posterior para levantarla y retirarla del teléfono.\n2. Después de retirar la cubierta posterior, inserte su dedo debajo de la batería y levántela como se muestra.\n3. Coloque una uña en la parte central del soporte metálico de la tarjeta SIM. Luego, suelte y abra el soporte de la tarjeta SIM. \n4. Inserte la tarjeta SIM en el soporte como se muestra, primero la esquina biselada, con los contactos dorados en la tarjeta SIM hacia arriba (lejos del teléfono).\n5. Gire el sujetador de la tarjeta SIM para que cierre. Los contactos dorados en la tarjeta SIM coinciden con los contactos dorados dentro del teléfono. Presione cuidadosamente  el soporte de la tarjeta SIM dentro del teléfono hasta que encaje en su sitio.\n6. Vuelva a colocar la batería, al colocarla (con el lado de la etiqueta hacia arriba), de manera que los contactos dorados coincidan con los del teléfono. Deslíce la batería hasta que encaje en su sitio. \n7. Deslíce la cubierta posterior hasta que encaje en su sitio.",
